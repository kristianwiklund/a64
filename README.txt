I needed to kill some time when on sick leave and wrote this. 

Don't use this for anything. I'm serious.

Macro assembler for C64 - capable of assembling a lot of the common formats. 
Which formats, I don't remember, the code was written 2005-2006-ish.

Requires bison, flex, ...

Compiles on newer linuxen but with a lot of warnings.
